sign up, subscribe to one of the available plans, log in, access `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/subscription-dashboard`, and go through the onboarding steps.

- When a user creates an account (signup) at `ProScheduleManager.placeholder`, the user will then have access to `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/my-account`.
- Once the subscription is purchased, the subscription owner can go to `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/dashboard` and proceed to set up the business account. The first step is to input the business name or use the suggested random name, which can be changed later. For this summary, letâ€™s use the company "Cleaning Angels".
- After a name is chosen, the business owner can access the dashboard at `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/cleaning-angels/dashboard` - tenant dashboard.
- The business owner can also add new admins, staff, and client users. These users can log in at `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/cleaning-angels/login` and access their portals:
  - `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/cleaning-angels/admin-portal` - tenant portal
  - `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/cleaning-angels/staff-portal` - staff portal
  - `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/cleaning-angels/client-portal` - client portal

- In the dashboard, the business owner can access all the features, including setting up a public custom white-label website that, when published, can be visited at `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/cleaning-angels` where customers can request quotes and book jobs. This website is optimized for search engine and social media sharing.
- The business owner can replace `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/cleaning-angels` with any domain. For example, `cleaningangels.domain`, which applies to the website, dashboard, and portals:
  - `cleaningangels.domain` - website
  - `cleaningangels.domain/dashboard` - tenant dashboard
  - `cleaningangels.domain/admin-portal` - tenant portal
  - `cleaningangels.domain/staff-portal` - staff portal
  - `cleaningangels.domain/client-portal` - client portal

- Super Admins can access the `ProScheduleManager.placeholder/dashboard` to manage and visualize analytics of the subscriptions. These accounts belong to `ProScheduleManager.placeholder`.

## Technology
